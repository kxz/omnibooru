# This is a collection of strategies for extracting information about a 
# resource. At a minimum it tries to extract the artist name and a canonical 
# URL to download the image from. But it can also be used to normalize a URL 
# for use with the artist finder. It differs from Downloads::RewriteStrategies
# in that the latter is more for normalizing and rewriting a URL until it is 
# suitable for downloading, whereas Sources::Strategies is more for meta-data 
# that can only be obtained by downloading and parsing the resource.
